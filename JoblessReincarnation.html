        <p> Jobless Reincarnation (or Mushoku Tensei in Japanese) is an anime series that follows the story of a 34-year-old man named Rudeus Greyrat, who dies in a traffic accident and is reincarnated into a magical world as a baby. With his previous life's memories intact, Rudeus is determined to make the most of his second chance and live a fulfilling life.
            Growing up in his new world, Rudeus discovers that he possesses exceptional magical abilities, and is trained in magic and swordsmanship by his parents and various tutors. As he grows older, he embarks on various adventures, including joining a group of adventurers and learning more about the world around him.
