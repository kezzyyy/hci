        <h2> Isekai Genre </h2>
        <p> The Isekai genre is a subgenre of Japanese anime and manga that has gained immense popularity in recent years. It is often characterized by its protagonist being transported from their ordinary world into a fantasy world, typically with RPG (role-playing game) elements. In other words, the protagonist is transported to a different world that is vastly different from their own.
            In an Isekai anime, the protagonist usually finds themselves with a new body or unique abilities, and they often have to navigate through the new world while learning about its rules and customs. The protagonist is also usually given a quest or a goal that they must achieve in order to return home or to complete their journey in the new world.
            Isekai stories can vary in tone and theme, ranging from comedic to serious, from action-packed to slice-of-life, and from romantic to adventure. However, the common thread among all Isekai anime is that they transport the protagonist to a different world and allow viewers to explore a new setting along with them. Overall, the Isekai genre has become a staple in the anime industry, and it continues to attract a large and dedicated fanbase.</p>
